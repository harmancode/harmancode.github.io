    <h2>Who am I?</h2>

    <p>Computers, video games, and software development... I have always been passionately interested in these topics, and after getting an LLM degree from University of Exeter üéì and working as a lawyer ‚öñ for more than 10 years, I finally realized my dream, and -while continuing my career as a legal advisor- I have started working as a software developer! ü•≥</p>

    <p>I have apps on the <span class="emphasized">App Store</span> that I programmed with <span class="emphasized">Swift</span>, desktop apps built with <span class="emphasized">Python</span> and <span class="emphasized">Delphi</span>, and web apps (created with <span class="emphasized">HTML</span>, <span class="emphasized">CSS</span>, <span class="emphasized">JS</span>, <span class="emphasized">jQuery</span>, <span class="emphasized">dJango</span>, and others).</p>

    <p>While I am actively working as a developer, I am pursuing a college degree in CS/CIT. I have a <span class="emphasized">GPA of 4.0</span>, and the courses I have taken so far include  <span class="emphasized">Database Design</span>, <span class="emphasized">Oracle SQL</span>, <span class="emphasized">Oracle PL/SQL</span>, <span class="emphasized">Programming Fundamentals: Python</span>, <span class="emphasized">Object-Oriented Programming: Java</span>, <span class="emphasized">Networking</span>, and <span class="emphasized">Unix</span>.</p>

    <p>Command and Conquer Tiberan Dawn, Civilization, the Witcher, Heroes of Might and Magic are some of my favorite games üéÆ.</p>

    <p>I love coffee ‚òï, good music üé∏, and taking daily walks üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.</p>

    <p>We, me and my family üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶, live in Austin, Texas ü§†.</p>

      <h3>Sayibul</h3>

      <p>It has many surprising features, such as single player and <span class="emphasized">multiplayer</span> gaming (<span class="emphasized">hot seat</span>, <span class="emphasized">LAN</span>, and <span class="emphasized">internet</span>), <span class="emphasized">in-game online chat</span>, four difficulty levels, calculation board, and more. It supports two languages.</p>

      <h3>DOS Games</h3>
      <p>I programmed a few DOS games (a typing-speed game, a platformer, a memory game, and a mastermind clone) with <span class="emphasized">Turbo Pascal 7.0</span> with great joy when I was a high-school student.</p>
      <p>
        It was a challenging pleasure for me in those ancient times. "google.com" was still probably an unregistered domain name, there was no internet at home (or anywhere in the country except a few universities), and reading the documentation was not an easy task, because my second-language that I was learning at school was not English, <em>es war Deutsch</em>! üòÖ.
      </p>
      <p>
        But, thanks to <span class="emphasized">Civilopedia</span> and <span class="emphasized">Monkey Island</span>, my English vocabulary was not so bad! (Doom did not help much)
      </p>
      <p>
        I will list those games here one day. They are nostalgically valuable for me.
