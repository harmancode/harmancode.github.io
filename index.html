    <h1>Welcome to Harman's page!</h1>

    <h2>Who am I?</h2>

    <p>Computers, video games, and software development... I have always been passionately interested in these topics, and after getting an LLM degree from University of Exeter and working as a lawyer for more than 10 years, I have realized my dream, and -while continuing my career as a legal advisor- I have started working as a software developer.</p>

    <p>I have apps on the App Store that I programmed with Swift, desktop apps built with Python and Delphi, and web apps (created with HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery, dJango, and others).</p>

    <p>While I am actively working as a developer, I am pursuing a college degree in CS/CIT. I have a GPA of 4.0, and the courses I have taken so far include database design, Oracle SQL, Oracle PL/SQL, Python, Object-Oriented Programming: Java, Networking, and Unix.</p>

    <p>Command and Conquer Tiberan Dawn, Civilization, the Witcher, Heroes of Might and Magic are some of my favorite games.</p>

    <p>I love coffee, good music, and taking daily walks.</p>

    <p>I live in Austin, Texas.</p>

    <h2>My Projects</h2>

    <h3><a href="https://masterlistapp.com">Masterlist: Focus & Tasks</a></h3>
    <p>An advanced task manager combined with a highly customizable Focus Timer, performance charts, stats, and time log. Available on the App Store.</p>
    <p>Built using Swift and XCode with native frameworks & technologies such as UIKit, Core Data, Local Notifications, AVFoundation, StoreKit, Localization and Internationalization, In-App Purchases, Networking, and third-party frameworks such as Google AdMobs (in previous versions), and other third-party libraries via CocoaPods. Maintained source control via Git.</p>
    <p>It supports Dark Mode. Widgets for iOS 14 are being added using SwiftUI in the next version.</p>

    <h3><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lydian/id1546931630">Lydian</a></h3>

    <p>A currency converter, and foreign exchange calculator for iOS. </p>
    <p>Built using Swift and XCode with native frameworks & technologies such as UIKit, Core Data, UITableView, Networking, JSON Encoding and Decoding with Codable protocol. It supports Dark Mode. Widgets for iOS 14 are being added using SwiftUI in the next version.</p>
    <p>Took advantage of REST API and JSON (Javascript Object Notation) to fetch and parse the latest exchange data from a third-party provider, and used Core Data to store the data locally for offline usage, just for fun.</p>

    <h3><a href="https://github.com/harmancode/Flashcards">Flashcards</a></h3>

    <p>Flashcards is a cross-platform study tool. It calculates which flashcards you should study, and how often, based on a psychologically-proven spaced repetition algorithm. Create, edit, import, and export your own decks and flashcards, and do not forget anything you learn ever again!</p>
    <p>Built with Python. Stores the data in a SQLite3 database. Database is managed with SQL queries. Object-oriented programming principles and techniques applied in a Pythonic way. CSV module is used to code import/export operations. GUI is designed by using tkinter libraries and its grid system. One-directory package made ready by pyinstaller. Maintained source control via Git.  Stored remotely on GitHub.</p>

    <h3><a href="https://ertugrulharman.com/en/sayibul/">Sayibul</a></h3>
    <p>Sayibul is a freeware code-breaking puzzle game for Microsoft Windows, a variant of famous “Bulls and Cows” game.</p>
    <p>The objective in the game is to find your opponent’s 4 digit secret number as early as possible with the help of the results of your previous guesses.</p>
    <p>It has many surprising features, such as single player and multiplayer gaming (hot seat, LAN, and internet), in-game online chat, four difficulty levels, calculation board, and more. It supports two languages.</p>

    <h3><a href="SimonGame/index.html">Simon Game</a></h3>
    <p>A simple memory game, a Simon clone, programmed with #JavaScript and #jQuery in 2021 to become more familiar with them.</p>
